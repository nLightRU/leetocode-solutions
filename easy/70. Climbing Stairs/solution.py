# You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

# Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 2 steps
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
# 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
# 2. 1 step + 2 steps
# 3. 2 steps + 1 step

class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        l = [0 for i in range(n)]
        l[0] = 1
        l[1] = 2
        for i in range(2, n):
            l[i] += l[i-1] + l[i-2]
        return l[n-1]
